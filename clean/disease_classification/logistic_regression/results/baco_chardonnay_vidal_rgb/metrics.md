# Disease: logistic regression on Baco + Chardonnay + Vidal, RGB bands only

Leaf mean spectrum → SNV → logistic regression, trained on the 3 training rows (the validation row is used only by the CNN). Balanced accuracy (0.5 = chance); a leaf counts as positive at P ≥ 0.5; 95% bootstrap interval.

## Macro average: leafroll and red blotch

The mean of the two balanced accuracies below (0.5 = chance); each disease counts equally. Its interval resamples leaves, keeping each row's mix of disease combinations.

| model | bal. acc. [95% CI] | Δ vs logistic regression [95% CI] | Fold 1 (R1) | Fold 2 (R2) | Fold 3 (R3) | Fold 4 (R4) | Fold 5 (R5) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| logistic regression | 0.574 [0.555, 0.593] | — | 0.603 | 0.543 | 0.622 | 0.542 | 0.607 |

Fold k tests on row Rk of every variety (3 field rows, since each variety has its own rows R1–R5); the next row (R1 after R5) is validation and the other 3 train.
