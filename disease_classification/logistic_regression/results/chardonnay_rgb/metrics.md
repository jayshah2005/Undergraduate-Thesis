# Disease: logistic regression on Chardonnay, RGB bands only: all metrics

A leaf counts as positive (diseased) at P ≥ 0.5; 95% bootstrap intervals. Sensitivity (= recall): share of positive leaves called positive. Specificity: share of negative leaves called negative. Precision: share of positive calls that are right. F1: harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity. Balanced accuracy: mean of sensitivity and specificity (for variety, mean sensitivity over the 4 varieties). Balanced accuracy alone, with folds and differences to logistic regression: `final_report.md`.
