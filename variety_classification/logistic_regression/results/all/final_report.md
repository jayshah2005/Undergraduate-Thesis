# Variety: logistic regression, Full spectrum (204 bands)

Leaf mean spectrum → SNV → logistic regression, C chosen on the validation row. Balanced accuracy = the mean of the 4 recalls (chance 0.25), with a 95% bootstrap interval. Every metric: `metrics.md`.

## Full spectrum (204 bands)

| model | bal. acc. [95% CI] | Δ vs logistic regression [95% CI] | Fold 1 (R1) | Fold 2 (R2) | Fold 3 (R3) | Fold 4 (R4) | Fold 5 (R5) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| logistic regression | 0.874 [0.853, 0.894] | — | 0.615 | 0.975 | 0.970 | 0.925 | 0.885 |

Fold k tests on row Rk of every variety (4 field rows, since each variety has its own rows R1–R5); the next row (R1 after R5) is validation and the other 3 train.

Recall per variety:

| model | Baco | Cab Franc | Chardonnay | Vidal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| logistic regression | 0.907 | 0.848 | 0.944 | 0.796 |

Chosen C per fold: 0.01, 10, 1, 10, 1.
